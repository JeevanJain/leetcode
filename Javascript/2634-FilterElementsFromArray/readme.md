#  [2634. Filter Elements from Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/filter-elements-from-array)

Given an integer array `arr` and a filtering function `fn`, return a filtered array `filteredArr`.

The `fn` function takes one or two arguments:

`arr[i]` - number from the `arr`
`i` - index of `arr[i]`

`filteredArr` should only contain the elements from the `arr` for which the expression `fn(arr[i], i)` evaluates to a truthy value. A truthy value is a value where `Boolean(value)` returns `true`.

Please solve it without the built-in `Array.filter` method.

### Examples
Example 1:
```
Input:
    arr = [0,10,20,30],
    fn = function greaterThan10(n) { return n > 10; }
Output: [20,30]
Explanation:
    const newArray = filter(arr, fn); // [20, 30]
    The function filters out values that are not greater than 10
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
    arr = [1,2,3],
    fn = function firstIndex(n, i) { return i === 0; }
Output: [1]
Explanation:
    fn can also accept the index of each element
    In this case, the function removes elements not at index 0
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 
    arr = [-2,-1,0,1,2],
    fn = function plusOne(n) { return n + 1 }
Output: [-2,0,1,2]
Explanation:
    Falsey values such as 0 should be filtered out
```

### Constraints
+ `0 <= arr.length <= 1000`
+ `-109 <= arr[i] <= 109`

    Start by declaring a new array which will eventually be returned.

    In Javascript, there is the concept of "truthiness" and "falsiness". Values such as 0, undefined, null, and false are falsy. Most values are truthy: 1, {}, [], true, etc. In Javascript, the contents of if-statements don't need to be booleans. You can say "if ([1,2,3]) {}", and it's equivalent to saying 'if (true) {}".

    Loop over each element in the array. If fn(arr[i]) is truthy, push it to the array.
